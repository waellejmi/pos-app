Everyone has an account in a Users table.
We make groups and put them into a Groups table. There's no permissions there, pretty much just a name and ID.
Each user is assigned 1 or more groups in a User_Group table. This is just the ID of their User model and the ID of the Group model.
We have a list of permissions in Permissions
Each group has a list of what permissions are Allowed or Denied in a Group_Permission table.
Users have one or more Groups and each group has one or more Permissions assigned to it.
